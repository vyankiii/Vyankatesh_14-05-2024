1] what is new keyword? why we use in java programming.

Answer: it is an identifier in java programming, part of the java keywords, with the help of new
        keyword we use to instantiate an object/instance.
        
        Note: creating an object nothing but, creating bundle with all properties of a class
        	  for this bundle we are giving name, that is reference name.
        	  
for Example,
        	  
public class Customer 
{
	//fields
	private int customerId;
	private String customerName;
	private long customerContactNo;
	private String customerAddress;
	
	/**
	 * if any constructor is not declared by a programmer then the compiler will provides a default/
	 * zero-parameterized constructor in class.	
	 */
	public Customer()
	{
		//to initialize an object(state), we use constructor.
		customerId = 101;
		customerName = "Anitha";
		customerContactNo = 9023451234l;
		customerAddress = "Pune";
	}
	
	public void getCustomer()
	{
		System.out.println(customerId);
		System.out.println(customerName);
		System.out.println(customerContactNo);
		System.out.println(customerAddress);
	}
	
}


above class we can treat as a template, we can create an instance based on class, 
with new keyword we creates an objects.


public static void main(String[] args) 
{
		
		Customer customer1 = new Customer();
		customer1.getCustomer();
		
		System.out.println("------------------------------");
		
		Student student1 = new Student();
		
}


- from the above program, line 50 indicates that, it is an object creation statement.

Customer customer1 = new Customer();

- Note: new keyword creates an objects based on java class name,

new Customer()

- customer1 is an object reference variable name, that is stores the type of object is Customer
  type, that is the reason,
  
 Customer customer1 = new Customer(); 
 
 Note: with the help customer1 reference variable name, we can access any property of the object.
